################## Some functions for the analysis of strokelitude data

######### Functions for getting paramters of the data (borders, the end, etc.)############

##### A function to determine borders of measurement periods, based on gaps in the data
getBorders <- function(flyTraces, threshold){
	
	# find the borders by finding timegaps in the data that are bigger than threshold (sec)
	jump <- c(0,(diff(flyTraces$Time) > threshold))
	borders <- unique(jump * flyTraces$Time)
}

##### A function to return the last second of the data
getLastSecond <- function(flyData){
	return(flyData$Time[length(flyData$Time)])	# return the last timestamp in the dataframe
}

##### A function to convert borders (e.g. from getBorders) to starting and ending timepoints of measurement periods
bordersToStarts <- function(borders, condOrder, lastSecond){ # given the borders and the order of conditions, get the starting and ending times of each measurement period
# condOrder should be a vector, the length of which is the number of measurement periods in the experiment.
# The number of value i in condOrder should indicate, which condition that measurement belonged to.
# For example, if there were three measurements, the first being baseline, the second condition A and the third again baseline, condOrder should be c(0,1,0) or c(1,2,1)
	
	if(length(borders) != length(condOrder)){                                                     # if the numbers of measurements do not match up
		stop("Number of measurements determined from borders does not match specified number.") # throw an error
	}

	conditions <- sort(unique(condOrder)) # determine the number of conditions and sort them in ascending order
	
	# initialize some housekeeping variables
	measurement <- c() # a vector to save the measurements of each condition
	startTimes <- vector("list", length = length(conditions))	# a list to save the vector of starting times for each condition
	endTimes <- vector("list", length = length(conditions))	# a list to save the vector of ending times for each condition

	# go through all conditions and determine the starting times
	for(ind in 1:length(conditions)){   # iterate the conditions (the 1:length(conditions) should protect against stupid numbering, e.g. orderCond <- c(0,4,5)
		measurement <- (condOrder == conditions[ind])		# get a logical vector, which is 1 for every measurement of the current condition
		startTimes[[ind]] <- unique(measurement * borders)	# save the timepoints at which the measurement periods start in startTimes
		if(measurement[length(measurement)] != 0){		# check if the last measurement belongs to this condition to avoid index-out-of-bound errors 
			measurement <- subset(c(0, measurement),as.logical(c(rep(1, times = length(measurement)-1),0))) # shift measurement one to the right, in order to get the end values of each measurement
			endTimes[[ind]] <- unique(measurement*borders)
			endTimes[[ind]] <- append(endTimes[[ind]], lastSecond)							# append the time of the end of the experiment in order to have the time the last measurement ended
		} else { # if the last measurement is not part of this condition, shift measurement one to the right
			measurement <- subset(c(0, measurement),as.logical(c(rep(1, times = length(measurement)-1),0))) # shift measurement one to the right, in order to get the end values of each measurement
			endTimes[[ind]] <- unique(measurement*borders)
		}
	}

	# return a list named output, which contains the list of starting vectors and the list of ending vectors
	output <- vector("list", length = 2)
	output[[1]] <- startTimes
	output[[2]] <- endTimes

	return(output)
}

##### a function to get the starting and ending times (same output as bordersToStarts) for data without gaps, either querying the user or using a hardcoded protocol
parameterQuery <- function(){

	# use I/O query to determine the paramters

	print("Please enter the number of conditions:")
	nCond <- scan(n=1)

	# read the number of measurements for each condition
	for(ind in 1:nCond){

		condLengths[ind] <- scan(n=1)
	}
	# initialize the vectors in which the starting end ending times will be saved
	startTimes <- vector("list", length = nCond)
	endTimes <- vector("list", length = nCond)
	for(ind in 1:nCond){
		startTimes[[ind]] <- vector("numeric", length = condLengths[ind])
		endTimes[[ind]] <- vector("numeric", length = condLengths[ind])
	}

##### a function that calculates starting and ending times from the length of the experiment and the number of measurements per condition
parameterCalc <- function(nCond, measLength, nMeas){

		endTimes[[condCount]] <- append(endTimes[[condCount]],ind*measLength)		# the interval ends a measurement interval later
		
		condCount <- condCount+1	# keep track of which condition you are in
		if(nCond < condCount){		# once you went through all conditions, start with the first again
			condCount <- 1

	##### return a list containing startTimes and endTimes
