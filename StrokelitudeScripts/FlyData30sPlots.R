####################### A script to plot a whole strokelitude trace in variable windows

## if you did not do so yet, set the right working directory
#setwd("F:/Master/FlyData")

## source the script with the functions needed for analysis
source("StrokePrepFunctions.R")

## ask the user how big the windows should be
print("Please enter the required window durations in seconds.")

##### read the data with the corresponding function
